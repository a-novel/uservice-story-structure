# Code of conduct

> This document is a WIP for the project. We are still working a lot of things for now (also I was bored).

Hello friend, and welcome to the Agora project. If you wish to participate in any way, we would be more than happier
with it. Please simply note the following rules:

## Every criticism is welcomed

Really. [Ad-Hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) insults do not count as criticism tho.

## We don't owe you anything

This is a personal project, and a side one morever. We'll try to answer any issue as long as it abide by the
rules in this document. However, we do not guarantee response time. Nor do we guarantee that we will fix your issue.

## Speak your mind, as long as it is relevant

Rant, swear, state your opinions as much as you want. 
However, please keep in mind this is a code project. Discuss only code-relevant issues.

## Provide solutions

A good starting point for a constructive criticism is to provide an alternate solution. Whether you are doing code 
reviews or discussing features, try to pair every remark with a potential solution (or at least a suggestion). 
Brainstorm your ideas if you lack one (pointing issues is still great).

## Understand before correcting

There is as many ways to code as there is developers. And every developer is the best in the world. There is no point
into forcing your way of writing code onto others.

As project maintainer, we try to ensure strict code guidelines, as coherence is the most important factor for
readability and maintainability. If you think something is done wrong, or can be improved, try to convince us
instead. Discuss it, show how we or the application can benefit from your suggestion. And if relevant, there is
a good chance we will implement it!

## Proofread and stay concise

You have time. This is Github not Twitter. No one cares if you post today or tomorrow. Take time to proofread 
your comments, issues, and all other contributions. Most people will only read them once.

## Everyone makes mistakes, you can't know if you don't ask

As long as you are willing to do good and listen, we will be happy to help you. If you are unsure about something,
go to the discussions, or get in touch with us directly! We'll work on providing relevant social media contact soon.

## Finally...

Make sure you read the contributing docs before pushing anything. We'll happily let you open pull requests, but
make sure those are discussed in issues, discussions or privately with code maintainers first.

## Have fun !
